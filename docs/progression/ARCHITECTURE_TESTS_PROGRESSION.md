## 1. About

Tracks the evolution and adoption of Tavall Studios' canonical executable architecture-testing layer, from its extraction out of Project Novus to its modular distribution and consumer integration model.

`tavall-docs` owns written architecture policy; this repository implements reusable, mechanically enforceable subsets of that policy as a Gradle plugin and test modules that consumer repositories execute during their own verification cycles.

## 2. Authority & Consumer Model

The division of authority is explicit:

- **Written Policy (`tavall-docs`)**: Canonical written architecture rules, design standards, module boundaries, and quality requirements.
- **Executable Enforcement (`tavall-test-suite-tools`)**: Reusable ArchUnit and AST-based rule implementations packaged as Gradle plugin and modular libraries.
- **Consumer Execution (Consumer Repositories)**: Each repository's canonical testing suite (`*-test-suite`, or root verification suite) applies `org.tavall.architecture-tests` and declares its production targets.
- **Historical Provenance (`repositories/`, `manifest/sources.json`)**: Preserved historical snapshots and imported commit hashes from Project Novus. These provide provenance only, not execution authority.

## 3. Progression Timeline

- **2026-09-07 - bootstrap architecture test repository (`2d25857`)**: Created the standalone repository to decouple architecture rule verification from individual product codebases.
- **2026-09-07 - import canonical architecture suite from Project Novus (`e1ed715`, PR #1)**: Imported core architecture tests and established initial standalone suite structure.
- **2026-09-07 - establish architecture test staging root (`f1d4258`)**: Established persistent staging root and quality validation gates.
- **2026-09-07 to 2026-09-08 - reusable CLI, MCP, and staging architecture contracts (`990f13f`, `0345070`, `fc90e8a`, `04e7be4`, `7257a4d`, PR #4)**: Defined reusable CLI/MCP contracts, prohibited new Repository type names, and distinguished release discovery from lease authority.
- **2026-09-10 - executable consumer gates (`dc8b90e`, `df7897e`, `53620bc`, `bef2f47`, PR #6, PR #3)**: Modularized architecture test runner, aligned consumer gates with runtime dependency ownership, defined repository `LOCAL_CI` entrypoint, and published complete consumer artifact graph to GitHub Packages.
- **2026-09-11 - canonical repository test-suite consumer model (`09dda79`, `90b0418`, `31b91cd`, `77aaa4f`, `c88fae9`, `9e29da6`, PR #7)**: Established repository testing suite (`*-test-suite`) as the canonical consumer boundary, replacing per-subproject duplicate gates with suite-owned target inspection.
- **2026-09-14 - update Tavall MC provenance repository name (`b38f994`, PR #9)**: Aligned provenance manifests with `tavall-mc` repository rename.
- **2026-09-19 - Tavall MC adopts canonical architecture suite**: Tavall MC consumer wired to canonical architecture-tests plugin via test suite boundary.
- **2026-09-22 - aggregate inherited DI marker debt and include compile classpaths (`0f6ca4c`, `81ae78d`, `3e71575`, PR #10)**: Aggregated retired DI marker debt handling and included consumer compile classpaths for comprehensive dependency analysis.
- **2026-09-23 - progression and lineage consolidation (`working/architecture-tests-progression-lineage-20260923`)**: Added canonical progression documentation, linked authority model to Tavall Docs, and bound repository verification contract.
- **2026-10-03 - Web frontend artifact ownership correction**: Updated the reusable Web rule to follow the current Tavall Web module DESIGN: the frontend library owns Page/rendering contracts and their compatibility package names, while the Web app and product surface modules consume the route API. Project-level checks now execute once per module even when Gradle supplies more than one Java source root.
- **2026-10-03 - producer source and exact-source integration (PR #21)**: The exact producer candidate is `working/web-frontend-artifact-ownership-20261003@13006ede`. Tavall-Web #58's shared-Executor request `85b6c8d9-e54c-49d9-b50a-2422ae6dcb02` exposed the stale frontend/API rule; producer Tavall CI and consumer revalidation are pending.

## 4. Module Matrix

| Module | Published Artifact | Enforcement Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gradle-plugin` | `org.tavall.architecture-tests` | Gradle integration, task registration (`architectureTest`), target class and source resolution |
| `modules/core` | `org.tavall:tavall-architecture-core` | Core type hygiene, forbidden imports, package boundary assertions |
| `modules/patterns` | `org.tavall:tavall-architecture-patterns` | General structural patterns, exception handling rules, immutable record conventions |
| `modules/di` | `org.tavall:tavall-architecture-di` | Dependency injection hygiene, constructor injection rules, singleton/lifecycle validation |
| `modules/registry` | `org.tavall:tavall-architecture-registry` | Registry registration patterns and lookup lifecycle enforcement |
| `modules/cache` | `org.tavall:tavall-architecture-cache` | Cache boundaries, TTL declarations, and thread-safety invariants |
| `modules/database` | `org.tavall:tavall-architecture-database` | Persistence isolation, transaction boundary rules, and entity constraints |
| `modules/runtime` | `org.tavall:tavall-architecture-runtime` | Shared runtime verification helpers and test fixture boundaries |

## 5. Validation and Acceptance Gates

1. **Standalone Suite Validation**: Root `./gradlew check` validates all rule modules and executes Gradle plugin functional tests.
2. **Package Publication Gate**: All artifacts publish to `TavallStudios/tavall-test-suite-tools` on GitHub Packages with verified POMs and Gradle metadata.
3. **Consumer Verification Gate**: Consumers execute `architectureTest` through their repository test-suite boundary; failure blocks local CI and PR promotion.
4. **Temporary Debt Gate**: Deprecated or legacy patterns permitted temporarily via `config/architecture-debt.txt`; non-matching entries cause immediate build failure to prevent debt creep.

The Web ownership rule change is being validated through Tavall CI on its exact producer head and then through the exact-source Web consumer composite. Source-check evidence and package-backed consumer resolution remain separate gates.
